- the min temp in June was 64 degrees while the min temp in December was 56 degrees, and the max temp in june was 85 degrees while the max temp in December was 83 degrees.
## Summary
Based on looking at tempatures specfically there is not much difference in the temperatures for this region despite the large gap in time bewteen the two data sets. additional queries that could be done are: a query to compare the rainfail in during June and December to determine when the lost rainfall was. Could potentially also check the averages at each station to see if different locations around the island vary in temperature.
